    "text": "John: Good morning everyone, thank you for joining on time. Let\u2019s start with project updates. \r\nAlice: Sure, I\u2019ve completed the first draft of the user interface. I think it looks clean, but I would love to hear your feedback.\r\nBob: I reviewed it last night, and overall it\u2019s good, but there are a few areas where navigation feels confusing.\r\nSarah: I agree with Bob. The design is modern, but maybe we need clearer labels on the buttons.\r\nAlice: That\u2019s fair, I can revise the labels and add tooltips to guide the user.\r\nJohn: Excellent teamwork! Small adjustments like that will make the interface much better.\r\n\r\nJohn: Now moving on to the backend progress. Bob, how are things going?\r\nBob: Honestly, the API integration is taking longer than I expected. Some of the third-party services have poor documentation.\r\nSarah: That\u2019s frustrating. Is there any way I can help with testing so we can at least move forward in parallel?\r\nBob: Yes, actually that would be great. If you can test the endpoints I\u2019ve already deployed, we\u2019ll save some time.\r\nSarah: Done, I\u2019ll take that action item.\r\n\r\nAlice: I want to raise one concern\u2014the timeline. We promised delivery in three weeks, but if integration delays continue, we may miss the deadline.\r\nJohn: You\u2019re right, that\u2019s a risk. Let\u2019s reassess the scope and see what features are essential for version one.\r\nBob: I can cut a few non-critical endpoints to make sure the main workflow is stable.\r\nSarah: That sounds like a good compromise.\r\n\r\nJohn: Perfect. Before we wrap up, let\u2019s quickly check morale. How\u2019s everyone feeling about the project overall?\r\nAlice: Optimistic. It\u2019s a lot of work, but I think we\u2019re moving in the right direction.\r\nBob: A bit stressed, but I believe once integration is done, the rest will be smoother.\r\nSarah: I feel motivated. I like how we\u2019re supporting each other and finding solutions.\r\nJohn: Great to hear. Let\u2019s keep this energy going. Meeting adjourned.",
